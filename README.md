How to use GitHub: Operations
Commit Command:
This operation helps you to save the changes in your file. When you commit a file, you should always provide the message, just to keep in the mind the changes done by you. Though this message is not compulsory but it is always recommended so that it can differentiate the various versions or commits you have done so far to your repository. These commit messages maintain the history of changes which in turn help other contributors to understand the file better. Now let’s make our first commit, follow the below steps:

Click on “readme- changes” file which we have just created.
Click on the “edit” or a pencil icon in the righmost corner of the file.
Once you click on that, an editor will open where you can type in the changes or anything.  
Write a commit message which identifies your changes.
Click commit changes in the end.
